# Data structures in Python

The best way to learn is by doing. In that spirit, it's been (many) years since I last took an algorithms and data 
structures class, and even then I didn't have the joy of *implementing* many of the data structures I'd learned.

To fill this gap in my life, and pave the way for others, I'd like to implement many of the common data structures in
 Python. This will happen in three steps:
 
 - Interface: I'll define an interface for each data structure, with common methods and attributes. This will help 
 scope work, and allow others to repeat this exercise
 - Tests: I'll write tests to confirm that my implementations behave as expected
 - Implementation: I'll end with writing working implementations for each data structure
 
## Quick start

TODO Describe running tests

TODO Describe implementing data structures on your own

## Environment

TODO Describe python version, requirements (?)

Hey, I'm Brendan Herger, avaiable at [https://www.hergertarian.com/](https://www.hergertarian.com/). Please feel free

I enjoy bridging the gap between data science and engineering, to build and deploy data products. I'm not currently pursuing contract work. 

I've enjoyed building a unique combination of machine learning, deep learning, and software engineering skills. In my 
previous work at Capital One and startups, I've has built authorization fraud, insider threat, and legal discovery 
automation platforms. In each of these cases I've lead a team of data scientists and data engineers to enable and 
elevate our client's business workflow (and capture some amazing data).

When I'm not knee deep in a code base, I can be found traveling, sharing my collection of Japanese teas, and playing 
board games with my partner in Seattle.
